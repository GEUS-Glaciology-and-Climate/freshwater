* Accessing this data
** Introduction

After the data have been downloaded, the =discharge.py= script allows access to outlets, basins, and their discharge within a region of interest (ROI). The ROI can be a point, a list describing a polygon, or a file. Optionally, upstream outlets, basins, and discharge from any land outlet(s) can be included. The script can be called from the command line (CLI) or within Python.

The ROI coordinate units can be either EPSG:4326 (lon,lat) or EPSG:3413. The units for the coordinates are guessed using the range of values. If the ROI is a point, basins that contain that point are selected. Either 1 (if the point is on land) or two (ice and the downstream land, if the point is on the ice) basins are selected, and optionally, all ice basins upstream from the one land basin. If the ROI is a polygon, all outlets within the polygon are selected. The polygon does not have to be closed - a convex hull is wrapped around it. If the argument is a file (e.g. KML file) then the first polygon is selected and used.

When the script is run from the command line, CSV data is written to =stdout= and can be redirected to a file. When the API is accessed from within Python, if the script is used to access outlets, a =GeoPandas= =GeoDataFrame= is returned and can be used for further analysis within Python, or written to any file format supported by =GeoPandas= or =Pandas=, for example =CSV=, or =GeoPackage= for =QGIS=. If the script is used to access discharge, an =xarray= =Dataset= is returned, and can be used for further analysis within Python, or written to any file format supported by =xarray=, for example =CSV= or =NetCDF=.

*** Database Format

This script queries two database:
 
+ land :: The land coast outlets and land basins.
+ ice :: ice margin outlets and ice basins.

The folder structure required is a =root= folder (named =freshwater= in the examples below, but can be anything) and then a =land= and =ice= sub-folder. The geospatial files for =land= and =ice= must be in these folders (i.e. the k=1.0 Streams, Outlets, and Basins dataset from https://dataverse01.geus.dk/dataverse/freshwater). Then, each of the =land= and =ice= folders must contain a =runoff= folder with the appropriate (MAR & RACMO) yearly discharge NetCDF files

Example:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :results verbatim :exports results
find ./freshwater/land/ -maxdepth 1
echo "./freshwater/land/runoff/MAR_<yyyy>.nc"
echo "./freshwater/land/runoff/RACMO_<yyyy>.nc"
find ./freshwater/ice/ -maxdepth 1
echo "./freshwater/ice/runoff/MAR_<yyyy>.nc"
echo "./freshwater/ice/runoff/RACMO_<yyyy>.nc"

#+end_example

*** Warnings

+ The script takes a few seconds to query the outlets and basins. The script takes ~10s of seconds to query each of the discharge time series datasets. Because there may be up to 6 discharge queries (2 RCMs for each of 1 land domain + ice domain + upstream ice), it can several minutes on a fast laptop to extract the data. To track progress, do not set the =quiet= flag to =True=.

+ If a polygon includes ice outlets, and the ~upstream~ flag is set, some ice outlets, basins, and discharge may be included twice, once as a "direct" selection within the polygon and once as an upstream outlet and basin from the land polygon. Further processing by the user can remove duplicates (see examples below).

+ The =id= column may not be unique for multiple reasons:
  + As above, the same outlet may be included twice.
  + =id='s are unique within a dataset (i.e. =land=, and =ice=), but not between datasets.

+ Due to bash command-line parsing behavior, the syntax =--roi -60,60= does not work. Use ~--roi=-60,06~.

+ Longitude is expected in degrees East, and should therefore probably be negative.

#+end_example

**** Outlets and basins
***** One point

The simplest example is a point, in this case near the Watson River outlet. Because we select one point over land and do not request upstream outlets and basins, only one row should be returned.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :exports both :results table
python ./discharge.py --base ./freshwater --roi=-50.5,67.2 -o -q
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| index |     id |     lon |    lat |       x |        y | elev | domain | upstream | coast_id | coast_lon | coast_lat | coast_x | coast_y |
|-------+--------+---------+--------+---------+----------+------+--------+----------+----------+-----------+-----------+---------+---------|

If we move 10° east to somewhere over the ice, there should be four rows: one for the land outlet and basin, and three more for the three ice scenario:

***** Polygon covering multiple land and ice outlets

Here a polygon covers several land outlets near the end of a fjord, and several ice outlets of the nearby ice margin. In addition, we request all ice outlets upstream of all selected land basins.

We use the following simple KML file for our ROI (this can be copied-and-pasted into the Google Earth side-bar to see it). Rather than use this file with ~--roi=/path/to/file.kml~, we use the coordinates directly, and demonstrate dropping the last coordinate because the code will wrap any polygon in a convex hull.

**** Discharge

The discharge examples here use the same code as the "outlets and basins" examples above, except we use =--discharge= rather than =--outlet=.

***** One point

The simplest example is a point, in this case near the Watson River outlet. Because we select one point over land and do not request upstream outlets and basins, two time series should be returned: =MAR_land_100= and =RACMO_land_100=. Rather than showing results for every day from 1958 through 2019, we limit to the header and the first 10 days of June, 2012.

+ If we move 10° east to somewhere over the ice we add two columns: One for each of the two RCMs over the ice domain.
+ If the =--upstream= flag is set, we add two columns: One for each of the RCMs over the *upstream* ice domains. Results are summed across outlets per domain.
+ Results are therefore one of the following
  + Two columns: 2 RCM * 1 land domain
  + Four columns: 2 RCM * (1 land + 1 ice domain)
  + Four columns: 2 RCM * (1 land + 1 upstream ice domain)
  + Six columns: 2 RCM * (1 land + 1 ice + 1 upstream ice domain)

***** Polygon covering multiple land and ice outlets

When querying using an ROI that covers multiple outlets, discharge is summed by domain. Therefore, even if 100s of outlets are within the ROI, either two columns, eight, eight, or fourteen columns are returned depending on the options.

*** Python API

The python API is similar to the command line interface, but rather than printing results to =stdout=, returns a =GeoPandas= =GeoDataFrame= of outlets, an =xarray= =Dataset= of discharge. The discharge is not summed by domain, but instead contains discharge for each outlet.

**** Outlets and basins

***** One point

The simplest example is a point, in this case near the Watson River outlet. Because we select one point over land and do not request upstream outlets and basins, only one row should be returned.

#+BEGIN_SRC jupyter-python :session using

df = discharge(base="./freshwater", roi="-50.5,67.2", quiet=True).outlets()
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

The =df= variable is a =Pandas= =GeoDataFrame=. 

It includes two geometry columns
+ =outlet= :: A point for the location of the outlet (also available as the =x= and =y= columns)
+ =basin= :: A polygon describing this basin

Because the geometry columns do not display well in tabular form, we drop them.

Finally, write data to various file formats. GeoPandas DataFrames can only have one geometry, so we must select one and drop the other before writing the file.

#+BEGIN_SRC jupyter-python :session using
df.drop(columns=["outlet","basin"]).to_csv("outlets.csv")
df.set_geometry("outlet").drop(columns="basin").to_file("outlets.gpkg", driver="GPKG")
df.set_geometry("basin").drop(columns="outlet").to_file("basins.gpkg", driver="GPKG")
#+END_SRC


**** Discharge

The code here is the same as above from the "Outlets and basins" section, but we call =discharge()= rather than =outlets()=.

***** One point

The simplest example is a point, in this case near the Watson River outlet. Because we select one point over land and do not request upstream outlets and basins, only one row should be returned.

#+BEGIN_SRC jupyter-python :session using
from discharge import discharge
ds = discharge(base="./freshwater", roi="-50.5,67.2").discharge()
#+END_SRC

In order to merge the outlets, select all coordinates that are *not time* and merge them. Also, apply a rolling mean:

#+BEGIN_SRC jupyter-python :session using
dims = [_ for _ in ds.dims.keys() if _ != 'time']  # get all dimensions except the time dimension
ds.sum(dim=dims)\
  .rolling(time=7)\
  .mean()\
  .sel(time=slice('2012-06-01','2012-06-10'))\
  .to_dataframe()

***** Polygon covering multiple land and ice outlets

Here a polygon covers several land outlets near the end of a fjord, and several ice outlets of the nearby ice margin. In addition, we request all ice outlets upstream of all selected land basins.
